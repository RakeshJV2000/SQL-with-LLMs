# SQL-with-LLMs
## Dynamic SQL Querying with LLMs using natural language

- Designed a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG)** architecture with Gemini-1.5-pro using Langchain and **few-shot training**
- Utilized Huggingface's embedding models to transform SQL queries and natural language inputs into vectors, stored in **ChromaDB**
- Built an end-to-end chain with LLMs, prompt template, and retriever, which showed a 10% increase in querying accuracy
